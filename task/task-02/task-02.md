**Test exercise for QA engineers**

Hi friends!
Here's a little challenge for you! 

Tasks you find here are solely established out of the many real-time interviews. Our team has prepared this ultimate list based on our experience as Quality Assurance Testers.

A software quality assurance engineer is someone who monitors every phase of the software development process so as to ensure design quality, making sure that the software adheres to the standards set by the development company.

So, first of all go to the source http://polandvisa-ukraine.com/scheduleappointment_2.html and test it including redirected pages (e.g. *"Призначити дату подачі документів"* etc).

***Perform the following steps:***


- *Write a requirements document.*

Requirements Gathering/Analysis phase is critical to the success of the project. 
Expectations (whether of a client or your team) need to be fleshed out in great detail and documented. 

- *Write a test plan.*

- *Build test cases.*

You should also create a test plan and detailed test cases to validate that the functional requirements are met.

- *Conduct tests and evaluate results.*

- *Document test results.*

Once your test documentation is designed, check your product and create a bug report (e.g. Excel spreadsheet).

***Good luck!***
